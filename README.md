# PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS 

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This data analysis project explores gender inequality within Palmora Group, a manufacturing company operating across three regions in Nigeria. Following recent media coverage branding the organization as “Palmora, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”, the company faces increasing scrutiny over its internal HR practices. By examining various aspects of the HR dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns, highlight disparities, and provide data-driven recommendations to address gender imbalance and improve equity within the workforce.

### DATA SOURCE

This analysis is based on two primary datasets:
- Palmoria Group emp-data.csv – Contains detailed employee information such as gender, department, region, salary, and ratings.
- Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx – Outlines the bonus allocation rules based on employee ratings and department.

It contains detailed information on the company’s workforce, including employee profiles and salary data. These datasets were merged to support an in-depth analysis of gender distribution, salary structure, bonus allocation, and gender-related disparities within Palmoria Group.

### TOOL
The analysis was conducted using Power BI [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
  - leveraging the Power Query Editor for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and merging.
  - This enabled seamless integration of the datasets and preparation of the data for visualization and insight generation.

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

In the initial phase of the project, the following steps were carried out:
1. Extracted, transformed, and loaded the employee dataset.
2. Extracted and loaded the bonus mapping data separately.
3. Merged both datasets to create a unified view for analysis.
4. Performed data cleaning and formatting, including:
    1. Handling missing or inconsistent values
    2. Adding calculated columns for bonus and total compensation
    3. Changing data types to ensure proper analysis in Power BI

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis phase focused on uncovering key insights from the HR dataset to better understand gender dynamics, salary structure, and regulatory compliance across Palmoria Group’s three regions. The following focus areas were explored:
- Bonus Calculation
    - Calculated the bonus amount payable to each employee based on their department and performance rating.
    - Computed the total compensation (salary plus bonus) for individual employees.
- Regional and Company-wide Salary Insights
    - Determined the total payroll amount per region and for the entire organization.
- Gender Distribution Analysis
    - Examined the gender breakdown across the company, with further analysis by region and department.
- Performance Ratings by Gender
    - Analyzed employee performance ratings to identify any patterns or disparities by gender.
- Salary Structure and Gender Pay Gap
    - Assessed the overall salary distribution to detect gender pay gaps.
    - Identified specific regions and departments where the pay gap is most significant and may require management attention.
- Compliance with Minimum Salary Regulation
    - Evaluated whether Palmoria meets the newly adopted regulation requiring a minimum salary of $90,000 for manufacturing employees.
    - Analyzed employee salary distribution in $10,000 bands (e.g., $10,000–$20,000, $20,000–$30,000, etc.)
    - Visualized salary bands across different regions to provide a comprehensive view of pay distribution.
