# PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS 

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This data analysis project explores gender inequality within Palmora Group, a manufacturing company operating across three regions in Nigeria. Following recent media coverage branding the organization as “Palmora, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”, the company faces increasing scrutiny over its internal HR practices. By examining various aspects of the HR dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns, highlight disparities, and provide data-driven recommendations to address gender imbalance and improve equity within the workforce.

### DATA SOURCE

This analysis is based on two primary datasets:
- Palmoria Group emp-data.csv – Contains detailed employee information such as gender, department, region, salary, and ratings.
- Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx – Outlines the bonus allocation rules based on employee ratings and department.

It contains detailed information on the company’s workforce, including employee profiles and salary data. These datasets were merged to support an in-depth analysis of gender distribution, salary structure, bonus allocation, and gender-related disparities within Palmoria Group.

### TOOL
The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging the Power Query Editor for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and merging. This enabled seamless integration of the datasets and preparation of the data for visualization and insight generation.
